I would like to submit my Game Visualizer that I build with DotNet Core.
It's making use of .Net Core with AngularJS and Bootstrap 4.
There are still some work required, but this should give us a Base Line to work from.
I also included a sample Replay to show off how this Visualizer works.

The requirements are that you need to download .Net Core SDK from https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core
and install it.

Then inside the ReplayZ folder, start a command prompt, and type these commands:

dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run
This should then start a webserver, which you can navigate to, to view the Visualizer.
